			<p>5 December has been marked as Saint Nicholas Day. Saint Nicholas was a bishop in Myra (present day Turkey), who helped the poor. He died on 6 December 342 and after he was declared a saint, this became his name day. </p>
			<h3 class="parade">The arrival parade</h3>
			<p>In November the arrival of Sinterklaas on his steamboat from Spain is celebrated with a colourful parade. He is seen sailing all over the canals and eventually you will get to shake his hand and receive some sweetness from the <em>Pieten.</em></p>
