			<p>Offerfeest is mainly known as a Muslim party, but you don't have to be Muslim to attend this party. It's for everyone! And this day has been marked as a day of being together, being united and having a good time with you dearest and nearest. Do you like to know more about the Islam or just want to attend this party with a Muslim friend, you're absolutely welcome.</p>
			<p>During this event there will be lots of delicious food and cookies, and lots of people to get to know.</p>
