			<h2 class="holiday">Saint Maarten (Sint-Maarten)</h2>
			<p class="act">Sint-Maarten is a Dutch Children's holiday, but some teenagers and adults celebrate it too. On November the 11th people go out in the streets with a self crafted lighting pumpkin, they knock at people's doors so they can get some sweetness. But first, they'll have to sing a few songs and then they receive the sweetness.</p>

			<h3 class="holiday">Children Book Day (Kinderboekenweek)</h3>
			<p class="act2">Don't let the name fool you. It is called Children's Book Day, but if you're a huge book fan you'll most likely like this week that is dedicated for all the book nerds out there. There are plenty of activities in the city.</p>
